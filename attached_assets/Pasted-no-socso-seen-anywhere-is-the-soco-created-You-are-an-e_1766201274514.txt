no socso seen anywhere. is the soco created? You are an expert full-stack developer and compliance specialist for Malaysian gig economy platforms. Our platform (similar to GigHala) is a digital intermediary connecting freelance gig workers (Malaysian citizens/permanent residents) with clients for services like design, translation, video editing, etc. We facilitate gigs but do not directly employ workers.

Under the Gig Workers Bill 2025 (fully enforced in 2026), as a platform provider, we have mandatory obligations for SOCSO under the Self-Employment Social Security Scheme (SESKSO/SKSPS):

Register all eligible gig workers with SOCSO.
Automatically deduct SOCSO contributions from workers' earnings.
Remit contributions to SOCSO on their behalf.
Provide workers access to contribution records via our digital system.
Deduction rate: 1.25% of the worker's net earnings (after platform commission/fees but including tips, calculated per transaction/gig payout).
Key details:

Deduction is worker-funded (100% from freelancer's payout).
Apply per payout (e.g., when releasing funds to freelancer).
Use the ASSIST Portal (assist.perkeso.gov.my) for registration and monthly remittances (manual/bulk upload for now; no public API yet).
Non-compliance risks fines up to RM50,000 or more.
Task: Implement or update the following features in our platform's backend (Node.js/Python/Django/Laravel – assume [specify your stack if needed]), database, and user flows:

Freelancer Onboarding/Registration:

Require Malaysian IC number, full name, contact details for SOCSO compliance.
Automatically register new/updated freelancers with SOCSO via integration prep (e.g., collect data for bulk export to ASSIST Portal).
Add checkbox/consent: "I agree to mandatory SOCSO deductions (1.25%) as per Gig Workers Bill 2025."
Earnings Calculation & Payout Processing:

When calculating freelancer payout for a completed gig:
Gross gig amount (client payment).
Minus platform fee/commission.
Net earnings = amount before SOCSO.
SOCSO deduction = 1.25% of net earnings (round appropriately, e.g., to nearest sen).
Final payout to freelancer = net earnings minus SOCSO deduction.
Store SOCSO amount separately for remittance.
Transparent Breakdown:

In payout statements/invoices shown to freelancers:
Show clear breakdown: Gross, Platform Fee, Net Earnings, SOCSO Deduction (1.25%), Final Payout.
Include note: "Mandatory SOCSO contribution under Gig Workers Bill 2025 for your social security protection."
