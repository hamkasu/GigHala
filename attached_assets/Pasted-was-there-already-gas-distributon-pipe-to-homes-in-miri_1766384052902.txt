was there already gas distributon pipe to homes in miri before malaysiaNo, there was no gas distribution pipeline to homes in Miri before the formation of Malaysia in September 1963.
Miri's oil production began in 1910 under Royal Dutch Shell during the Brooke and later British colonial era in Sarawak, but this focused primarily on crude oil. Natural gas was associated with oil fields, but large-scale commercial utilization and distribution for domestic use came later.
Reliable sources indicate that piped natural gas supply to homes in Miri started in 1965, when Shell initiated a gas distribution system (initially through the Miri Public Works Department, later via Sarawak Gas Distribution Sdn Bhd). This made Miri the first place in Malaysia with such infrastructure.
Earlier mentions (e.g., some claims of supply "since British colonial time") appear anecdotal or inaccurate, as no historical records support domestic piped gas before 1963. Gas infrastructure expanded significantly post-independence, tied to offshore discoveries and processing in the 1960s–1970s.
Today, Sarawak Gas Distribution Sdn Bhd (under Petroleum Sarawak Berhad/PETROS) supplies piped natural gas to over 25,000 households in Miri, with ongoing expansions.1.6sFast55 sourcespropose about us for calmic sdn bhd from their website calmic.com.my, myparliament.calmic.com.my, storykeep.calmic.com.my and gighala.calmic.com.my2 / 2About Us
